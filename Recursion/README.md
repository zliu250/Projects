# Recursion algorithm

This program fills an image in 2d int array form. Given the boundary and the fill number, the 2d array will recursively fill out the array within the boundary.

## build
    make all
    
## Running
    ./prog0
    
## Cleaning
    make clean
    
## Command option
    the program takes input from stdin, the input should be specifically formatted to fit in the program. 
    For example:
    
    rows cols\n
    boundary\n
    fill number\n
    row idx to start, col idx to start\n
    the 2d array with the correct dimension and formatted with %4d% spaces for each, enter a newline with each row
